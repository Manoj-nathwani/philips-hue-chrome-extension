# Getting started
- Download the repository
- Follow the instructions <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked" target="_blank">here</a> on adding an unofficial extension to chrome
- The extension lazily uses `newdeveloper` as the username for accessing the hub's API, so follow the instructions <a href="http://www.developers.meethue.com/documentation/getting-started" target="_blank">here</a> on setting up that account (step 3 is where `newdeveloper` is added)
